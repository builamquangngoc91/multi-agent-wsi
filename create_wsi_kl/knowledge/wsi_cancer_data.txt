## Grading and Staging Systems

### Universal Grading Principles
- **Grade 1 (Well differentiated)**: >75% glandular formation, minimal nuclear pleomorphism, low mitotic activity
- **Grade 2 (Moderately differentiated)**: 50-75% glandular formation, moderate nuclear pleomorphism, moderate mitotic activity
- **Grade 3 (Poorly differentiated)**: <50% glandular formation, marked nuclear pleomorphism, high mitotic activity
- **Grade 4 (Undifferentiated)**: No glandular formation, extreme nuclear pleomorphism, very high mitotic activity

### TNM Staging Integration
- **Primary tumor (T)**: Size, local extension, organ involvement
- **Regional lymph nodes (N)**: Number and extent of nodal involvement
