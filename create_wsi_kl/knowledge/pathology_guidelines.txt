### Architectural Pattern Analysis

#### Glandular Patterns
- **Well-formed glands**: Regular, organized glandular structures with clear lumina
- **Moderately formed glands**: Partially organized with some irregularity
- **Poorly formed glands**: Poorly organized, irregular, or difficult to identify
- **Cribriform pattern**: Sieve-like appearance with multiple small lumina
- **Papillary formation**: True papillae with fibrovascular cores vs pseudopapillae
- **Solid growth**: Sheet-like, nested, or trabecular arrangements without glandular formation

#### Growth Pattern Classifications
- **Expansile growth**: Pushing borders with minimal infiltration
- **Infiltrative growth**: Irregular, invasive growth pattern with stromal infiltration
- **Cohesive growth**: Cells growing in cohesive groups or clusters
- **Single cell infiltration**: Individual cells scattered through tissue (Indian file pattern)
- **Mixed patterns**: Combination of growth patterns with relative proportions

### Stromal and Microenvironmental Assessment

#### Stromal Reactions
- **Desmoplasia**: Extensive, moderate, or minimal fibrotic response with collagen deposition
- **Inflammatory infiltrate**: Type (acute, chronic, mixed), density, and distribution
- **Necrosis**: Type (coagulative, liquefactive, caseous), extent, and pattern
- **Hemorrhage**: Presence, extent, and significance
- **Calcification**: Presence, type (dystrophic, metastatic), and distribution

#### Vascular and Lymphatic Assessment
- **Vascular invasion**: Presence, extent, and significance for staging
- **Lymphovascular invasion**: Identification criteria and prognostic significance
- **Perineural invasion**: Presence and extent with clinical implications
- **Angiogenesis**: Microvessel density and neovascularization assessment

## Grading and Classification Systems

### Universal Grading Principles
- **Grade 1 (Well differentiated)**: 
  - >75% glandular/tubular formation
  - Minimal nuclear pleomorphism (uniform, small nuclei)
  - Low mitotic activity (<10 mitoses per 10 HPF)
  - Minimal necrosis

- **Grade 2 (Moderately differentiated)**:
  - 50-75% glandular/tubular formation
  - Moderate nuclear pleomorphism (moderate size variation)
  - Moderate mitotic activity (10-20 mitoses per 10 HPF)
  - Focal necrosis

- **Grade 3 (Poorly differentiated)**:
  - <50% glandular/tubular formation
  - Marked nuclear pleomorphism (significant size and shape variation)
  - High mitotic activity (>20 mitoses per 10 HPF)
  - Extensive necrosis

- **Grade 4 (Undifferentiated)**:
  - No recognizable glandular/tubular formation
  - Extreme nuclear pleomorphism (bizarre, giant nuclei)
  - Very high mitotic activity with atypical mitoses
  - Extensive necrosis and hemorrhage

### Specific Grading Systems
- **Nottingham Histologic Grade** (breast cancer): Tubule formation + nuclear pleomorphism + mitotic count
- **Gleason Score** (prostate cancer): Primary + secondary architectural patterns
- **Fuhrman Grade** (renal cell carcinoma): Nuclear size, shape, and nucleolar prominence
- **Edmondson-Steiner Grade** (hepatocellular carcinoma): Cellular and architectural differentiation

## Language and Terminology Standards

### Professional Medical Language Requirements

- Maintain consistency in abbreviations and acronyms throughout

### Standardized Medical Terminology
- **Morphological identification characteristics**: Specific cellular and architectural features used for diagnosis
- **Visual and architectural features**: Microscopic appearance and tissue organization patterns
- **Histopathological analysis**: Comprehensive tissue examination and interpretation
- **Diagnostic criteria**: Established parameters for definitive diagnosis
- **Prognostic factors**: Morphological features correlating with clinical outcomes

### Measurement and Quantification Standards
- **Linear measurements**: Micrometers (μm) for cellular features, millimeters (mm) for tissue measurements
- **Area measurements**: Square micrometers (μm²) or square millimeters (mm²)
- **Counting standards**: Per high-power field (HPF) at 400x magnification
- **Percentage assessments**: Relative proportions of different components
- **Density measurements**: Cells per unit area or microvessel density per mm²
