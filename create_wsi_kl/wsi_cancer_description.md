  "Chromophobe Renal Cell Carcinoma (chRCC)": [
    "On gross examination, the tumor is a well-circumscribed, tan-brown solid mass.",
    "Microscopically, large polygonal cells show prominent, plant-like cell membranes.",
    "Cells have pale, flocculent cytoplasm and characteristic perinuclear halos.",
    "Nuclei are irregular and wrinkled with a classic 'raisinoid' appearance.",
    "Thick-walled, hyalinized blood vessels are typically seen throughout the tumor.",
    "The tumor is characteristically positive for CK7 and KIT (CD117) by IHC.",
    "It is typically negative for CAIX, distinguishing it from clear cell RCC.",
    "The key pathogenetic event involves losses of multiple chromosomes.",
    "Prognosis is generally favorable compared to other renal cell carcinoma subtypes.",
    "The presence of sarcomatoid features indicates a poor prognosis."
